## Introduction
This project aims to introduce Machine Learning (ML) methods to students in the social sciences. I collaborated with social scientists and students from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and various universities to develop a comprehensive introductory course including:
1. Learning materials
2. Teaching slides for instructors
3. Coding practices tailored to students at the introductory level
The course covers a wide range of topics, from classical methods to cutting-edge applications, such as deep learning and computer vision.

The learning materials are characterized by a high-level overview, providing intuitive explanations, and focusing on the essence of the methods. The emphasis is on understanding why these methods work and how they achieve their objectives, rather than delving into technical details.
